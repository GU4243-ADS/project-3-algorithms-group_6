### [Project Description](./doc/project3_desc.md)

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: Algorithms
+ Team Number: 6
+ Team Members: David Arredondo, Sophie Beiers, Huijun Cui,	Richard Shin, Shan Zhong,
+ Project summary: Many online sites rely on recommendation systems to better target their user with ads, information or products that their user may enjoy. Collaborative filtering is one such way to better recommend items to a particular user; by searching for other users who have similar interests, algorithms are able to make more accurate suggestions and recommendations. For this project, we utilized memory-based and model-based algorithms to generate predictions for two datasets: Microsoft Web Data and EachMovie data. The memory-based model considered Spearman's correlation, Pearson's correlation, entropy, mean-squared-difference, SimRank and rating normalization as weights, and we utilized the EM algorithm for the clustering model.
