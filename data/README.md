# Project 3: Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in particular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. EachMovie as well as the Microsoft Data can be found here in ready-to-use format (RData or csv). Please see eachmovie_sample and MS_sample for untouched original datasets.
